# Discord-Bot 
This bot was created using Python and the Discord Developer Portal

For this project, I will be creating a discord bot that allows you to to have some basic functionalities in your discord server such as response to texts, ability to tell times, and a few other features. 

--Note that the bot token identifier has been removed due to security concerns. Bot will not be online without the token identifier.
